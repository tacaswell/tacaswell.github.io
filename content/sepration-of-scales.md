This post is based on a talk I gave at PyData Global 2020.

As programmers we work in deeply layered systems. When a layer below us “just
works” things feel easy and life is great! However, all to often it feels like
our tools fight back and get in the way. In this post, we will discuss how to
identify the good scales and abstractions in software, and how to build
pleasant tools for ourselves and others.
