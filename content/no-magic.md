In the context of this well known Author C Clark quote, it is common to various
aspects of software called "magic". Slack has a sign-in workflow that they call
["magic link"](https://www.waveguide.io/examples/entry/passwordless-login/))
and I will colloquially refer to command line methods as
["incantations]({filename}intermediate-git.md).  However, [computers can be
understood](https://blog.nelhage.com/post/computers-can-be-understood/).  This
quote should be re-framed more optimistic way as:

> "All 'magic' is just good engineering"

This framing acknowledges the hard work that goes into making computers "just
work".  The next time you use an computer and it is perfect, smooth experience
that exactly solves your problem remember there was a team of people who worked
very hard to make that happen.  There is work at every level, from designing
then interaction, to implementing the layers involved, to making sure the
services at every layer of the stack are running to designing and fabricating
the hardware.  If any layer of this (massive) stack does not work just right,
your experience will fail.

I find this an empowering point of view.  Magic is mystical, arcane, something
secret that is closely held, something that you have to be born with, something
super natural.  Once something is deemed "magic" it is out of the ken of mere
mortals; it must be accepted as-is, there is no point in even trying.

On the other hand science and engineering exist to be understood.  They are
systematic frameworks to understand the physical world and bend it to our will
respectively.  Understanding any given system (natural or engineered) may not
be easy and may take more time and energy than you want to spend, but it is
always possible in principle.  The statement is never "I can not understand
this", it is always "I do not understand this _yet_".

The tools and methods of science and engineering are open to anyone who has the
time, resources, and inclination to use them; anyone who says differently
([like those who deny life is pain](https://youtu.be/KS_f6O8mWsk)) is selling
something.  However, while this position is well and good in theory, in reality
there are massive structural inequalities in who actually participates in STEM
broadly and open source development specifically.  It is incumbent on those of
us who work in STEM fields to ensure equitable access and opportunity to all.
Just like a good science challenge this is not going to be easy, but it must be
"We have not fixed this _yet_".
