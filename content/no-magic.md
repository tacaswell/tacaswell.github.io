Summary: Computers are not magic, but there is some very slick engineering out there.

In the context of this well known Author C Clark quote, it is common to various
aspects of software called "magic". Slack has a sign-in workflow that they call
["magic link"](https://www.waveguide.io/examples/entry/passwordless-login/))
and I will colloquially refer to command line methods as "incantations.
However, [computers can be
understood](https://blog.nelhage.com/post/computers-can-be-understood/) this
quote can be re-framed more positively as:

> "All 'magic' is just good engineering"

This framing acknowledges the hard work that goes into making computers "just
work".  Every time you use an computer at it is just a perfect experience,
remember that there is a team of people who worked very hard to design that
interaction and make sure every layer of stack, from the CPU to the UI, work
together to make it happen.

I also find this empowering.  Magic is mystical, arcane, something secret that
is closely held, something that you have to be born with, something super
natural.  Once something is deemed "magic" it is out of the ken of mere
mortals; it must be accepted as-is.

On the other hand science and engineering exist to be understood.  We do
science to understand the physical world and engineer to systematically bend
the physical world to our will.  Understanding any given system (natural or
engineered) may take more time and energy than you want to spend, but it is
always possible in principle.  The tools and methods are open to anyone who has
the time, resources, and inclination to use them.  Anyone who says differently
([like those who deny life is pain](https://youtu.be/KS_f6O8mWsk)) is selling something.

This is all well and good in theory, however in reality there are massive
structural inequalities in who actually participates in STEM broadly and open
source development specifically.  This is harmful to the individuals who are
driven out of the field by gate-keeping and marginalization, it is harmful to
the projects who lose the talents and efforts of those people, and harmful to
the wider community because the projects are than much poorer as a result.
