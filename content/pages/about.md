I am a soft-condensed matter physicist by training, but now work as a Research
Software Engineer to enable scientist who use computers to do science via open
source software.

I am a [Computational Scientist at
NSLS-II](https://www.bnl.gov/staff/tcaswell), the current Project Lead of
[Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org), and a core contributor for
[h5py](https://docs.h5py.org/en/stable/).

This blog will cover Software Engineering, API design, and open source software &
community.
